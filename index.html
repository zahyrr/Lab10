	<h1>From TV to Web Videos</h1>
	<p>Remember when the whole family sat together in a room focusing on a bulky boxed machine with a huge dial that allowed us to watch only what was on, families shared this experience by getting together in a room, all looking towards this box and listening to the sounds coming out of its speakers. You had to turn it on and the device brought in information and entertainment into our lives. This device is called a <b><i>television</i></b> and the moving pictures with sounds is called <b><i>a video</i></b>.</p>
	<p>The television over the years has been replaced by mobile phones or other smart devices and the videos are delivered through internet, making the viewing experience of videos more personal. With the amount of videos out there, everyone has their own preferences when it comes to <strong><em>web videos</em></strong>.</p>
